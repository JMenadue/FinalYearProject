# FinalYearProject

My final year project at University. A virtual reality snare drum using the Unity game engine and HTC Vive virtual reality headset.
This project made use of the SteamVR development tools for Unity and some free assets on the Unity asset store.

Below is the poster I designed for a showcase of the disseration projects on our course.
